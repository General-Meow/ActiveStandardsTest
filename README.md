# ActiveStandardsTest
Calculate days between dates.

Decisions made:
- Task is very procedural so didnt need to use inheritance
- chose not to use an DI
- ended up using singleton classes
- all tests mocked as much as possible
- created a wrapper class for console input, just so i can mock it with mockito
